                <p class="type-body-2 light ">I've been studying for three years at the Design and Technology program at Parsons School of Design. My background has played an integral role in developing a mission of creating thoughtful work that helps people and serves to make meaningful
                    stories accessible. I’ve learned heavily from working with non-profits and local businesses in New York City and Montgomery, Alabama that fight towards greater education equity and climate advocacy. In my work, I focus on interaction
                    design, physical computing, and real-time visualizations. In my free time, I like to create graphic art posters using typography and geometric forms, paint portraits of humans and animals, and play the flute, guitar, or piccolo.

                <h3 class="type-heading-3 ">Welcome inspiration.</h3>
                <p class="type-body-2 "> My goal is to use design to connect concepts, cultural moments, and people in a compelling way. I tend to look for inspiration from observation, conversation, and formal design research to stretch my perspective. </p>

            <div class="value-list ">
                <h3 class="type-heading-3 ">Be empathetic.</h3>
                <p class="type-body-2 "> I consider how my product will intervene in the system its a part of, as well as how it will affect the people within that system. I remember that others experience the world differently and ask how I can make my products most acessible.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="value-list ">
                <h3 class="type-heading-3 ">Embrace experimentation.</h3>
                <p class="type-body-2 ">I strive to branch out in my work and make new discoveries with every step of the design process. I try to always stay curious and allow myself to learn new and more meaningful ways to solve problems that help me turn my ideas into real
                    experiences.
