<p>I’m a creative technologist focused on exploring new technologies and their social impact. My background as a first-generation Korean American has played an integral role in developing a mission of creating thoughtful work that helps people and serves to make meaningful stories accessible. I’ve learned heavily from working with non-profits and local businesses in New York City and Montgomery, Alabama that fight towards greater education equity for historically underrepresented communties. In my work, I work in interaction design, physical computing, and real-time visualizations. In my free time, I like to create graphic art posters using typography and geometric forms, paint portraits of dogs and humans, and play the flute, guitar, or piccolo. </p>
